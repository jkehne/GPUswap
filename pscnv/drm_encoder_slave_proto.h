 *		dependent. It will usually be a structure with DVO port
 *		data format settings or timings. It's not required for
 *		the new parameters to take effect until the next mode
 *		is set.
 *
 * Most of its members are analogous to the function pointers in
 * &drm_encoder_helper_funcs and they can optionally be used to
 * initialize the latter. Connector-like methods (e.g. @get_modes and
 * @set_property) will typically be wrapped around and only be called
 * if the encoder is the currently selected one for the connector.

 * drm_i2c_encoder_init() provides a way to get an implementation of
