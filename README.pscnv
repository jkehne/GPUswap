# pscnv - PathScale NVIDIA graphics driver
#

pscnv is an open-source NVIDIA graphics driver developed by PathScale.
It is available either for graphics or compute (general-purpose computations
on GPUs, a.k.a., GPGPU) applications.
To build the driver, you will need envytools, a rich set of useful tools and
documentations for NVIDIA graphics cards - follow the instructions below. 

1. Make a working directory

mkdir $(YOUR_FAVORITE_PLACE)

2. Build envytools

cd $(YOUR_FAVORITE_PLACE)
git clone git://0x04.net/envytools.git
cd envytools
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. # may require you to install some more packages
make
sudo make install # will install the tools to /usr/local/{bin,lib}

3. Build pscnv

cd $(YOUR_FAVORITE_PLACE)
git clone git://github.com/pathscale/pscnv.git
cd pscnv
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
cd pscnv
sudo insmod pscnv.ko # or modprobe
